# CoRE Website
## [Current Link](https://core-bing.github.io/) (should lead to core.binghamton.edu, if it doesn't, we have bigger problems)
### Currently maintained by Salaj and Luca

***

## Current Functionality/Design
* Has working links on the top bringing the user to each division
* Has a blue theme throughout the whole page. This was a re-color of Gabby's design, but I wouldn't be opposed to a thematic overhaul
* Working links to the CoRE admissions form and Kate's email
* Colors come up when the user hovers over the images

## Possible issues or improvements

* Add more pages?
	* One for CoRE links? (Maybe put some sort of barrier so randoes can't access them)
    		* we used to have this
	* Current (and maybe elected) e-board page
	* CoRE Socials (Can maybe make buttons on the bottom of the main page too)

* Quality of Life Improvements:
	* Rebuild the website from the ground up, including sepreate pages where warranted.
   	* It would be nice to have the merch page actually work, but this requires a little more logistics than just making one, of course.
	* Maximize appeal to be a member of CoRE
	* Updated Photos

## More ToDos from Luca:
* I just cleaned up this README, it kinda looked like I'm talking to myself, but in a creepy way
	* Well I mean, I kinda am
		* yeah, you should do something about that
			* thanks Luca.
				* No problem.
