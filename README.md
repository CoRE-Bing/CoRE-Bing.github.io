# CoRE Website
## [Current Link](https://core-bing.github.io/) (Will hopefully lead to core.binghamton.edu soon)
### Currently maintained by Salaj and Luca

***

## Current Functionality/Design
* Has working links on the top bringing the user to each division
* Has Gabby's cool CoRE blue theme throughout the whole page
* Working links to the CoRE admissions form and Ajahni's email
* Colors come up when the user hovers over the images

## Possible issues or improvements
* I've been told more color on the page would be nice
	* Maybe make the colors stay static on the pictures?
	* The interactions are nice so maybe keep those with static colors?
* Make the gif image thing on top a singular unit with the CoREVo?
* What are these weird structure spinny things in the background? They seem to overlap with the text
* Add more pages?
	* One for CoRE links? (Maybe put some sort of barrier so randoes can't access them)
	* A Gallery?
	* Current (and maybe elected) e-board page
	* CoRE Socials (Can maybe make buttons on the bottom of the main page too)
* The link to Gabby's LinkedIn no longer works
	* Personally I don't really think it should be there. The e-board page should get rid of the desire for it anyway.

## Luca's Current TODO List:
* Quality of Life Improvements:
	* Rebuild the website from the ground up, including sepreate pages where warranted.
		* Shop page for merch would be fucking awesome
	* REMOVE THE LINKEDIN (Doing this first) [DONE]
	* Maximize appeal to be a member of CoRE
	* EMPHASIS ON APPLICATION!
	* Updated Photos

## More ToDos from Luca:
*  I have a lot of work to do here. I want to give the page a more "technical" feel in order to match what CoRE is all about
   * I also want to place a much heavier emphasis on the SOCIAL aspect of CoRE, because honestly; CoRE is a family, and while our page currently makes this appearent, I feel like it could do a much better point of pushing that point.
* I probably should also clean up this README, it kinda looks like I'm talking to myself, but in a creepy way
	* Well I mean, I kinda am
		* I'll fix this at some point
			* thanks Luca.
				* No problem.
