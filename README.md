# CoRE Website
## [Current Link](https://core-bing.github.io/) (Will hopefully lead to core.binghamton.edu soon)
### Made by: Gabriela Banaag
### Currently maintained by: Nicholas Reyes

## Current Functionality/Design
* Has working links on the top bringing the user to each division
* Has Gabby's cool CoRE blue theme throughout the whole page
* Working links to the CoRE admissions form and Ajahni's email
* Colors come up when the user hovers over the images

## Possible issues or improvements
* I've been told more color on the page would be nice
	* Maybe make the colors stay static on the pictures?
	* The interactions are nice so maybe keep those with static colors?
* Make the gif image thing on top a singular unit with the CoREVo?
* What are these weird structure spinny things in the background? They seem to overlap with the text
* Add more pages?
	* One for CoRE links? (Maybe put some sort of barrier so randoes can't access them)
	* A Gallery?
	* Current (and maybe elected) e-board page
	* CoRE Socials (Can maybe make buttons on the bottom of the main page too)
* The link to Gabby's LinkedIn no longer works
	* Personally I don't really think it should be there. The e-board page should get rid of the desire for it anyway.
